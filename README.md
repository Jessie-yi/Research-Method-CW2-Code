Environmental Impact Visualization by Diet Group

1. Project Title
Environmental Impact Visualization Based on Diet Groups

2. Introduction
This project explores the environmental impacts associated with different diet groups. Using interactive visualizations, we aim to reveal patterns and significant differences in greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use, and other environmental factors.

3. Dataset
The dataset contains individual dietary data, grouped into six diet categories, with associated environmental impact metrics.

4. Diet Groups
Vegan
Vegetarian
Fish
Low meat consumption (Meat_low)
Medium meat consumption (Meat_medium)
High meat consumption (Meat_high)

5. Environmental Indicators
Mean GHG emissions
Mean land use
Mean water scarcity
Mean eutrophication
Mean biodiversity impact
Mean water use
Mean acidification
Impact score (derived average of above indicators)

6. Visual Designs
Scatter Matrix: Interactive scatterplot matrix comparing environmental indicators across diet groups.
Radar Chart: Interactive radar chart showing average impacts per diet group.

7. Data Preparation
Extracted diet group information from grouping field.
Created an "impact_score" by averaging seven environmental indicators.
Standardized group names for consistency.
